# Introduction

**Solid X** is a open sourced UI component library built using [Solid JS](https://solidjs.com). It implements
Google's new UI design - [Material You](https://m3.material.io).

It includes a comprehensive collection of production ready components. They can be used right out of the
box with little to no configurations.

Solid X also features many customization options which makes things way simpler if you want to use your
own design system on top of our components.
